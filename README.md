# JS-Password-Generator

For this assignment, I built a random password generator along a series of pre-defined parameters. Mainly in focus were the ideas of character type submissions and length requirements, both of which are functional in the final product. Speaking of, the deployed project can be located [here](https://roberttilton.github.io/JS-Password-Generator/).
